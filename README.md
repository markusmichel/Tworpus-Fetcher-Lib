Tworpus-Fetcher-Lib
===================

Console application for downloading Tweets as XML Files.

## Description
The TworpusFetcher tool is is a console application, which can fetch tweets from the Twitter website.
It makes requests to Twitter searching for specific tweet- and userids.
The content of the resulting HTML-sites ist parsed for meta-information as well as the tweet messages.
The values are saved to XML files.

In the first step, the fetcher creates one xml file per tweet.
When all tweets are downloaded, all defined files are merged to one (or more) big XML file.

The information about which tweets to fetch are defined in a CSV file which need to be passed on program start.

Example:
```csv
"tweetid","userid","language"
"450253576754100000",759700000,"en"
"450253576754100001",759700001,"en"
```

Compatible CSV files can be generated by https://github.com/markusmichel/Tworpus-CSV-fetcher.
